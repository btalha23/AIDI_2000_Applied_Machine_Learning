## Assignment #1: Titanic Survival Prediction
The goal of this assignment is to build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features.

In order to fullfil the goal of the task, a total of six ML models were utilized here. These models are inclusive of

1. Random Forest Classifier
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. SVC (Support Vector Machine Classifier)
4. Logistic Regression
5. Gradient Boost Classifier
6. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

For all the models a variety of performance metrics, namely,
1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F1-Score
5. Confusion Matrix
6. ROC Curves with AUC

were calculated and analyzed.
